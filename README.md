## Introduction

Instance segmentation is a critical task in computer vision, enabling the identification and delineation of individual objects within an image. Traditional supervised methods require large labeled datasets, which can be costly and time-consuming to obtain. CAST aims to address this challenge by employing semi-supervised learning techniques combined with contrastive learning.

This repository contains the code, data, and instructions needed to implement CAST for your own instance segmentation projects. 

## Key Features

- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance.
- **Contrastive Learning**: Utilizes contrastive loss to enhance feature representation.
- **Instance Segmentation**: Provides precise segmentation masks for multiple objects.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model, improving efficiency.
- **Easy Integration**: Compatible with existing computer vision frameworks.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dwiaskor99/contrastive-distillation.git
   cd contrastive-distillation
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the pre-trained models and datasets from the [Releases section](https://github.com/dwiaskor99/contrastive-distillation/releases). Ensure to follow the instructions provided in the release notes.

## Usage

To use the CAST implementation, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset according to the specifications outlined in the repository. Ensure that your data is organized into labeled and unlabeled sets.

2. Configure the training parameters in the `config.yaml` file. This file allows you to set various hyperparameters, including learning rates, batch sizes, and the number of epochs.

3. Start the training process with the following command:
   ```bash
   python train.py --config config.yaml
   ```

4. After training, evaluate the model on your test dataset:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model_path path/to/your/model.pth --test_data path/to/test/data
   ```

5. Visualize the results using the provided visualization scripts:
   ```bash
   python visualize.py --results_path path/to/results
   ```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation provided in the `docs` folder.
